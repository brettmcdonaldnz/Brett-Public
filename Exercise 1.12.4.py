#Type print("hello"). Python executes this, which has the effect of printing the
#letters h-e-l-l-o. Notice that the quotation marks that you used to enclose the string are
#not part of the output. Now type "hello" and describe your result. Make notes of when
#you see the quotation marks and when you donâ€™t.

print("hello")

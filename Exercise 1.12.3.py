#Type 1 2 and then hit return. Python tries to evaluate the expression, but it can’t because
#he expression is not syntactically legal. Instead, it shows the error message:
#File "<interactive input>", line 1
#1 2
#^
#SyntaxError: invalid syntax
#In many cases, Python indicates where the syntax error occurred, but it is not always
#right, and it doesn’t give you much information about what is wrong.
#So, for the most part, the burden is on you to learn the syntax rules.
#In this case, Python is complaining because there is no operator between the numbers.
#See if you can find a few more examples of things that will produce error messages when
#you enter them at the Python prompt. Write down what you enter at the prompt and the
#last line of the error message that Python reports back to you.
